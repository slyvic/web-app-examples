# pwa-examples

Examples for progressive web apps.

In this repo, we currently have:

* [a2hs](a2hs): An example set up to show how Add to home screen (A2HS) works. [See it live here](https://mdn.github.io/pwa-examples/a2hs/). This includes an icon and [manifest file](a2hs/manifest.webmanifest) for allowing the app to be added to home screen, and a [simple service worker](a2hs/sw.js) for making the site work offline.
